Backlog

- wrap services in a Docker container (see /Users/jan/dev/microservices/micro-a/containers)
- replace Rabbit with Kafka
	- find out what status of integration/Vagrantfile in micro-a project is
- investigate performance hit of introducing queues
	- notify/query pattern
- try out scale on demand, mesos? swarm?
- design a user interface

- one change at a time
- support for multiple versions
- try and migrate clients from v1 interface to v2 interface
- follow request using some log trace tool
- allocate response time budget to limit time use by a single service
- routing based on version


blog:

- coordinator is necessary because process by itself is a concept in the domain,
to organise process, clean up junk.
- versioning by deploying multiple versions of the container. needs routing component to make sure
each process uses the correct version of each service. maybe, topic based version could live
alongside shopmanager version without problems
- use a document to ship state around, keep away from magic technology because it causes code bloat
and tighter coupling between business code and interface.
- Try out Kamon to monitor request flow
- Try out Netflix libs to track Clerk process and stop if it takes to long
